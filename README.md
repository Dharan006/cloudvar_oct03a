# **Agro Soil Monitoring and Steering System**

This project is an Internet of Things (IoT) based smart agriculture system designed to monitor **Soil Moisture** and **NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)** levels in real time using an **ESP32 microcontroller**. The system sends live sensor data to the **Arduino IoT Cloud** and allows farmers to **remotely control the irrigation motor** using a relay. The objective of this project is to improve crop productivity, reduce water wastage, and support precision farming through real-time monitoring and automation.
